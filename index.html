            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Coming this Summer, Game of Thrones will be entering it's second-to-last season of the hit HBO fantasy drama. While this saddens many of the fans, there is a vast amount of content for HBO and/or potenitally other studios to adopt on-screen. All of them would be a prequel series of events that would take place before the timeline of ASOIAF (A song of Ice and Fire). But, fans of both the tv series and of the novels would be excited to learn of the content that could be adapted for the big or small screen.</p>

           </h2>
            <p class="lead">Robert's Rebellion, also known as the War of the Usurper, was a rebellion against House Targaryen, primarily instigated by Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn, and Robert Baratheon, for whom it is named. It lasted "close to a year" and resulted in the end of the Targaryen dynasty in the Seven Kingdoms and the beginning of Robert Baratheon's reign.</p>

            <p class="lead">The First Blackfyre Rebellion, originally called the Blackfyre Rebellion, was a war fought between the loyalist forces of King Daeron II Targaryen and the rebel forces of his half-brother, Daemon I Blackfyre. Conflict arose when Daemon, a bastard son of the late King Aegon IV Targaryen, claimed the throne of his older, true born brother, King Daeron II Targaryen, which resulted in open civil war that divided the Seven Kingdoms.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Dunk and Egg stories are an ongoing series of novellas written by George R. R. Martin, set in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, prequels to the main novels. The stories relate the adventures of the hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall, who would become a legendary member of the Kingsguard, and his squire Egg, who would become King Aegon V Targaryen of Westeros. The stories begin with their meeting eighty-nine years before the events of the main novels (209 AC), and may cover the events until the deaths of Duncan and King Aegon.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Aegon's Conquest, also called the Conquest, was the campaign in which Aegon I Targaryen conquered most of Westeros. Supported by his sisters—Visenya and Rhaenys—their dragons, and a small army, Aegon subdued six of the Seven Kingdoms, successfully resisted only by Dorne. Not all the continent had to be taken by conquest, as some regions and houses actively supported House Targaryen and others submitted voluntarily.</p>
